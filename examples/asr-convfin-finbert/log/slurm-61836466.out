2021-07-23 12:14:24 WARNING  Model 'TurkuNLP/bert-base-finnish-cased-v1' not recognized as an MXNet model; treating as PyTorch model
Some weights of the model checkpoint at TurkuNLP/bert-base-finnish-cased-v1 were not used when initializing BertForMaskedLMOptimized: ['cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForMaskedLMOptimized from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPretraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForMaskedLMOptimized from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
